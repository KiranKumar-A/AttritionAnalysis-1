# Employee Attrition Analysis
This project seeks to analyze what factors cause employees to leave a company. 

## Problem
Companies seek to retain and attract top talent and experience in order to grow their company's success and influence. A decreasing company retention rate is not only damaging economically (in terms of hiring costs and loss of talent) but also socially (in terms of morale, productivity, and public image). With such strong incentive for companies to identify and reverse high employee turnover, an answer to what causes talented and/or experienced employees to leave prematurely is highly sought after. An analysis that identifies the strongest correlating features that relate to employee chur and a model to identify potential warning signs at an employee level will reduce incurred expenses to find replacements, including recruiting, advertising, hiring and training, etc. and increase morale to boost employee productivity and the company's public image.

## Approach
For this project we are using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. The dataset includes numerous specifics about employees such as number of previous jobs, pay, education levels, satisfaction levels, and time spent commuting and traveling for work.  Each employee has a field specifying whether they left the company and how long they worked there. This dataset gives details into many possible causes for an employee to become unsatisfied with their current work situation. It also provides us with the granularity to see how factors contributing to employee attrition differ by age, gender and education.

The dataset was simulated by IBM scientists in order to open source the study of attrition rates. Note, other data sets in this topic area are also simulated as companies are not allowed to release this data due to sensitivity concerns.

This dataset will be used to create models that will allow companies to identify which factors are having the largest impact on their attrition rates and to identify employees that are likely to leave.
